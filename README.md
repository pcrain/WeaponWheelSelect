# Weapon Wheel Select 2.0

(Better Icon Pending)

An updated port of the original [Weapon Wheel Select mod by Morphious86](https://thunderstore.io/c/enter-the-gungeon/p/Morphious86/WeaponWheelSelect/), with several enhancements:

- Modernized code for BepinEX: now uses Harmony for patching and publicized fields for reflection
- Shaders have been rewritten and recompiled to work on MacOS and Linux as well as Windows
- Memory usage has been optimized and a handful of potential memory leaks have been fixed

## Credits

- [Morphious86](https://thunderstore.io/c/enter-the-gungeon/p/Morphious86/) - writing the original Weapon Wheel Select and generously sharing the original shader code, which helped tremendously with the port
- Captain Pretzel - porting, optimization, and bugfixes

## Original Description Below

This mod replaces the game's clunky weapon select with a more robust interface, displaying all weapons at once.
Use either your mouse or left joystick to choose the gun you want to equip, then let go of the gun menu button to confirm the selection.

**Why?**
Having to scroll through each gun individually can get tedious, especially the more guns you have. 
This aims to remedy that issue entirely.
